# 🏪 Merchant System - Outfred

## Overview
The merchant system allows users to manage their online stores and products through the platform.

## How It Works

### 1. Merchant Application
Users can apply to become merchants through the "Join as Merchant" page. Applications are submitted with:
- Brand name
- Contact information
- Store description
- Website (optional)

### 2. Admin Approval
Admins review merchant applications in the Admin Panel:
- **Pending**: New applications awaiting review
- **Approved**: Merchants can access their dashboard
- **Rejected**: Applications that were declined

### 3. Linking Merchants to Users
Admins can link merchant stores to user accounts:
- In Admin Panel → Merchants tab
- Edit merchant or create new merchant
- Select user from dropdown in "Link to User" field
- The `userId` field connects the merchant to the user

### 4. Merchant Dashboard
Once approved and linked, merchants can:
- Access their dashboard from Account page
- View store information
- Add/Edit/Delete products
- Upload product images
- Set prices and categories

## Database Structure

### Merchant Object
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  userId: string | null,  // Links to user account

## Notes

⚠️ **Important**: When a user is assigned merchant role, they need to:
1. Have a merchant store created by admin
2. The merchant store must be linked to their user ID
3. The merchant status must be "approved"
4. Only then they can access the merchant dashboard

💡 **Tip**: Use the Admin Panel to quickly create and link merchants to users for testing
