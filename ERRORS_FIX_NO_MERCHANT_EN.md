## 🛠️ Fix Linking Issues:

If store exists but doesn't show, the issue might be in linking.

### Verify:

#### 1. **userId matches**
```javascript
// In Console
console.log('User ID:', user.id);
console.log('Merchant userId:', merchant.userId);
// Should be same value
```

#### 2. **Email matches**
```javascript
// In Console
console.log('User email:', user.email);
console.log('Merchant contactEmail:', merchant.contactEmail);
// Should be same value
```

---

## 📊 How the System Works:

### 1. **Create Store** (JoinMerchant.tsx)
```typescript
await merchantsApi.create({
  name, brandName, email,
  userId: user?.id,  // ← Link to user
  status: 'pending'  // ← Under review
});
```

### 2. **Find Store** (MyStore.tsx)
```typescript
const merchant = merchants.find(m => 
  m.userId === user.id ||       // ← Search by userId
  m.contactEmail === user.email // ← Or by email
);
```

### 3. **Check Status**
```typescript
if (merchant.status === 'pending') {
  // Show "Pending Approval" screen
} else if (merchant.status === 'rejected') {
  // Show "Rejected" screen
} else if (merchant.status === 'approved') {
  // Show full dashboard
}
```
