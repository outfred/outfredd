## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. 🌐 **Real Website Scraping**

**Problem:** Website scraper was only returning 2 demo products instead of actual products from the website.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented real HTML scraping using `fetch()`
- Extracts products by finding price patterns and nearby text
- Searches for product names, images, and details in context
- Handles relative URLs and converts them to absolute URLs
- Removes duplicates automatically
- Now extracts up to 100 products from any website

**Code Location:** `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` - `fetchFromURL()` function

**Test URL:** `https://asilieg.com/collections/all`

---

### 2. 🔍 **Search Results Display**

**Problem:** Search results weren't showing product images properly.

**Solution:**
- Added proper image display with fallback
- Shows product brand if available
- Displays price in EGP format
- Added product counter in results header
- Better error handling for broken images
- Line-clamp for long descriptions

**Code Location:** `/pages/Home.tsx`

**Features:**
- Image with fallback to placeholder
- Product brand display
- Price formatting
- Responsive grid layout

---

### 3. 🏪 **Merchants Page**

**Problem:** Merchants page wasn't showing merchant information correctly.

**Solution:**
- Fixed merchant name display (`name` OR `brandName`)
- Added address display if available
- Improved card layout
- Better handling of missing data

**Code Location:** `/pages/Merchants.tsx`

---

### 4. 👤 **Merchant Dashboard Access**

**Problem:** Hard to find merchant dashboard from account page.

**Solution:**
- Added large, prominent dashboard card at the top
- Beautiful gradient design
- Clear call-to-action button
- Bilingual labels (AR/EN)
- Only shows for merchant accounts

**Code Location:** `/pages/Account.tsx`

**Visual:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏪  Merchant Dashboard                     │
│      Manage your store, products...         │
│                    [Open Dashboard ➜]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Scraping Algorithm

```typescript
1. Fetch HTML from URL
2. Find all price patterns (EGP, LE, $, etc.)
3. For each price:
   - Extract 600 chars before, 300 after
   - Find product name in context
   - Find product image in context
   - Build product object
4. Remove duplicates
5. Return unique products
```

### Supported Price Formats
- `EGP 299`
- `LE 450`

- `SAR 200`
- `AED 180` (UAE Dirham)
