# Quick Fix: No Products in "My Store" 🔧

## Problem
When opening "My Store" page, it shows "No products yet".

## Quick Solution ⚡

### Step 1: Get your Merchant ID

1. **Go to "My Store"** (`/#my-store`)
2. **Click on "Analytics" tab**
3. **Find "Diagnostic Info" panel** at the top
4. **Copy "Merchant ID"** - there's a copy button next to it

**Alternative:** In the "Products" section, if no products exist, the Merchant ID is displayed directly with a copy button.

### Step 2: Use Merchant ID when Importing

1. **Go to "Import" page** (`/#import`)
2. In **"1️⃣ Select Merchant"** section:
   - You can select merchant from dropdown
   - **OR** Paste Merchant ID in "enter Merchant ID manually" field
3. **Choose import method** (CSV/Website/API)
4. **Enter required data**
5. **Click "Start Import"**

## Diagnosing the Issue 🔍

### Open Console (F12)

When opening "My Store", you'll see helpful messages in Console:

```
🔍 Loading merchant data for user: user@email.com
📦 Merchants response: {...}
✅ Found merchant: {...}
🔍 Loading products for merchant: merchant-id-here
📦 Products response: {...}
✅ Products count: 0
```

**Check:**
- ✅ Was merchant found? (`Found merchant`)
- ✅ Is Merchant ID present? (`merchant-id-here`)
- ✅ Is product count zero? (`Products count: 0`)

## Possible Causes 🤔

### 1. No Products Imported
**Solution:** Import products from "Import" page

### 2. Products Linked to Different Merchant
**Problem:** During import, a different merchant ID was used

**Solution:**
1. Get correct Merchant ID from "My Store"
2. Re-import products using correct ID

### 3. Merchant Not Approved
**Problem:** Merchant status is "Pending" or "Rejected"

**Solution:**
1. Check merchant status in "Diagnostic Info" panel
2. If "Pending", wait for approval
3. If "Rejected", contact support

## Import Methods 📥

### Method 1: CSV
```csv
